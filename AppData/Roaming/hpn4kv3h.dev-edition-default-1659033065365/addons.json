Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"homepageURL":"http://www.one-tab.com","supportURL":"http://www.one-tab.com","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1909,"reviewCount":973,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":3198,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3946687/onetab-1.59.xpi","updateDate":1652169617000},{"id":"momentum@momentumdash.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/793/793541-32.png?modified=1654191860","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/793/793541-64.png?modified=1654191860","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/793/793541-128.png?modified=1654191860"},"type":"extension","name":"Momentum","version":"2.6.17","creator":{"name":"Momentum Dashboard","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11149894/"},"developers":[],"description":"Replace your new tab page with an all-in-one productivity dashboard.

Protect your passwords and personal information with Keeper® - the leading secure password manager and digital vault. Keeper offers unlimited password storage for everyone - generate, store, and AutoFill strong passwords on all your devices while securely storing private documents.\n\nWhy Use Keeper Password Manager?\n\n• We help you easily generate and store strong passwords. No more sticky notes!\n\n• Our autofill feature makes signing in to your favorite websites a breeze across all of your devices.\n\n• We protect your confidential files, photos, and videos in a secure encrypted vault.\n\n• Keeper lets you securely share individual passwords or files with people you trust.\n\n• Our new Version History feature provides a valuable audit tool allowing you to view the date a record was modified, revert to a previous version, or permanently delete it from your vault.\n\n• Our Emergency Access feature enables you to elect up to 5 trusted individuals to access your account in the event of an emergency.\n\nWhat Makes Our Password Keeper The Best?\n\n• Every user is provided a secure and private vault protected by our unmatched Zero-knowledge security architecture with multiple levels of encryption. Each user's vault is guarded by a master password which only the user knows.\n\n• Keeper generates strong passwords inside the vault. Creating a unique and strong password to each website is critical to limiting the risk of being hacked.\n\n• KeeperFill™ provides a powerful and easy-to-use autofill feature. In addition to autofilling passwords, Keeper saves new passwords to the vault as you type.\n\n• Keeper’s Security Audit feature helps you identify which accounts require a password update and can generate a strong password for you with a single click.\n\n• Keeper protects your confidential files with military-grade encryption. Easily add files, photos, and videos to your vault and organize them with folders.\n\n• You can share passwords or files directly with another Keeper user or with a group of people you trust. Behind the scenes, information is encrypted with the recipient's public key and decrypted with their private key.\n\n• Easily switch between multiple Keeper accounts (like a business and personal vault) when you log in.\n\n• Keeper uses multiple layers of encryption by storing your data in our own secure cloud versus competitors who use partial encryption on their cloud or rely on third parties for password storage.
